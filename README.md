# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to display data from a sampling of bacteria found in volunteers' belly buttons.  The company conducting the bacteria is conducting an analysis to support the development of the next synthetic beef. There is potential for a bacteria found growing in a human belly button to produce a protein that could be used to grow a synthetic beef substitute.  This dashboard allows a volunteer to select their ID number and then view a series of graphs displaying the bacteria found in their belly button sample.
